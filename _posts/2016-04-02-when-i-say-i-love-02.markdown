I love the way you 
    visit each night and fill my dreams with desire.
    touch my hand and fill my soul with fire.
    draw me near for a warm and loving embrace.
    
I love the way
    when I close my eyes I see your smiling face.
    your lips meet mine for a passionate kiss.
    just thinking about you fills my heart with bliss.

I love the way you never forget to kiss me hello or goodbye.

I love the way God's blessed me with such a wonderful girl!.
