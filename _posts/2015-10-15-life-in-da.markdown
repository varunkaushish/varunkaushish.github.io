It was a warm summer evening in London( thinking again...It was bit chilly given, I now live in Dubai) when I was offered to join the team in Dubai and in spite of looking at picture with serious moustache on IM, I said “Yes” i’ll do it.
Full of excitement and enthusiasm, like I won a golden ticket to the chocolate factory, I started my Dubai visa (and i’m not talking about card scheme here) process and for the first time in my life, i looked at my Date of birth certificate, and rest of the process was just piece of cake (pun intended here).
