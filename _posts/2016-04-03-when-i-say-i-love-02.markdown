I love the way you visit each night and fill my dreams with desire <br>
I love the way you touch my hand and fill my soul with fire <br>
I love the way you draw me near for a warm and loving embrace <br>
I love the way when I close my eyes I see your smiling face <br>
I love the way your lips meet mine for a passionate kiss <br>
I love the way just thinking about you fills my heart with bliss <br>
I love the way you never forget to kiss me hello or goodbye <br>
I love the way God's blessed me with such a wonderful girl! <br>
