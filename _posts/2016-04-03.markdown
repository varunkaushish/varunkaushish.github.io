It’s 6 am and i want to be lying next to you
with our hands locked together, and our legs intertwined

I want your face buried in my neck
and i want to listen to your breathing

I want you to wake up and tell me 
“I’m so tired and sleepy”
Because i want to say
“Go back to sleep”
and i want to hold you tighter when you do

There are nights when I reach around you 
and pull you to me, like a child with his teddybear, 
like I am your comfort.

I want to lie in bed alone with you 
in the quiet of the early morning hours, 
and maybe read a book while you sleep

I want to be simple with you 
and i want to be whatever you need me to be
